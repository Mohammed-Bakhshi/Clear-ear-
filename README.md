# Clear Ear Appointment Tracking App

**Clear Ear** is an ENT clinic specializing in audiology and ear health. They hired me to develop a robust mobile app to streamline their appointment tracking, patient management, and historical data recording. This app ensures efficient management of bookings and enables the clinic to maintain detailed records of patient visits, medications, and personal history.
